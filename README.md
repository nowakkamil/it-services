###### A customer-oriented solution for the IT Services company.

A design and implementation phases had two main objectives throughout the entire shipping process. First one was to create as _elegant and appealing UI_ as possible. This was achieved by mainly relying on the _vector_ assets. In my opinion, the biggest contributor to the overall aesthetics was the **SVG** files. They have significantly improved the visuals, and their presence has made a distinctive mark on the website.

The second goal was to provide a vibrant yet harmonious _experience_ for the _user_. The motion was the answer. The **GSAP** animation library and the **barba.js** one blended brilliantly with each other. Had it not been for this duo, the final solution wouldn't have been that accessible for future maintenance. In terms of scalability, this was a perfect decision as well. The **ES6** syntax has made the entire development quite amusing and liberating, so to speak.
