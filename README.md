###### A customer-oriented solution for the IT Services company.

A design and implementation phases had two main objectives throughout the entire shipping process. First one was to create as _elegant and appealing UI_ as possible. This was achieved by mainly relying on the _vector_ assets. In my opinion, the biggest contributor to the overall aesthetics was the **SVG** files. They have significantly improved the visuals, and their presence has made a distinctive mark on the website.

The second goal was to provide a vibrant yet harmonious _experience_ for the _user_. The motion was the answer. The **GSAP** animation library and the **barba.js** one blended brilliantly with each other. Had it not been for this duo, the final solution wouldn't have been that accessible for future maintenance. In terms of scalability, this was a perfect decision as well. The **ES6** syntax has made the entire implementation phase quite amusing and liberating, so to speak.

## Development

As far as the development is concerned, I have followed the **BEM** convention and taken advantage of all perks that come from working with **SCSS** files. The **babel** compiler made it possible for me to write in _ES6_ syntax. **ESLint**, as well as **Codacy**, takes care of the quality of the source code. **Travis CI** made it incredibly convenient to control the current build status. I have also taken leverage of **GitHub Pages** and its compatibility with _Travis_ to quickly deploy the project. **Renovate** bot ensures that no dependency is outdated. The **webpack** serves as a bundler.
